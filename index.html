    "things are never as complicated as they seem. It is only our arrogance that prompts us to find unnecessarily complicated answers to simple problems.Peace is freedom from poverty. Peace is freedom from the threat of war. Peace is freedom from injustice. Peace is freedom from all the forces that threaten human life and dignity. Peace is the freedom to grow, to develop, to be human."
